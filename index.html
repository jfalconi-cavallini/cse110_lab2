        I was born in Peru on March 16,2000. I am a junior at UC San Diego studying Computer Science. Some of my favorite hobbies include going to the gym, hanging with the boys, and going on spontaneous adventures. I also really enjoy watching movies and/or programming videos when I am very bored.
