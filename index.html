        I was born in Peru on March 16,2000. I am a junior at UC San Diego studying Computer Science. Some of my favorite hobbies include going to the gym, hanging with the boys, and going on spontaneous adventures. I also really enjoy watching movies and/or programming videos when I am very bored.

        Some of my Favorite Computer Science Projects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Battle Bot:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Constructed a robot using Raspberry Pi, circuits, sensors, and Pi camera and programmed it in Python to search for target color red, differentiate from other obstacles through blurring and HSV values.</li>
            <li>It learned to compensate for motor error and live movement by diffing the images and adjusting direction through the use of GPIO and servos.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>StreamLine Game:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Using Java, implemented the backend of the streamline game, checked for winning scenarios, and created the backend part under linux.</li>
            <li>Handled Key events and created the frontend of the game by using JavaFx.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>StackBase Calculator:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhanced a stack-based calculator in Java, C, and C++ over 6 5 different assignments.</li>
            <li>Incorporated backend use of hashtable, binary tree, and linked-lists to the Stack-Based Calculator</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
